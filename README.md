## About **CryptoJewels** Website

  We are here to share precious information, Jewels and opportunities in Crypto. This website will be
especially very helpful to new crypto learners who want a simple and concise website to show them
some of the best resources in cryptocurrency. 

  The categories of cryptocurrency which we want to share are the top 5 centralized exchanges, top 5 decentralized exchanges, the top 5 chartproviders, some crypto top jewels(which i personally find interesting and useful) and
last a contact us form for reaching out to us if there are any queries/questions or intention to collaborate.

[One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.]

Design Process

We wanted to design a website to help give beginner crypto learners a good introduction and sharing in the following areas so that
they can level up their crypto learning journey faster. In this first edition, we are sharing the following information:
1. Top 5 Centralized Crypto Exchanges.
2. Top 5 Decentralized Crypto Exchanges.
3. Top 5 Crypto Chartproviders.
4. Top 3 Crypto Jewel Resources Links.
5. A Contact Us Form Page for learner enquiries, feedback and/or collaboration purposes.

For 1, we use span inline blocks with images(which is the 5 exchanges respective logos) as hyperlinks to let learners 
click and direct themselves to the top 5 exchanges homepage to familiarise themselves.

For 2, we use flex containers for each dex text (which serves as both hyperlink and dex descripter name)  and dex company logo which
are iconic to each dex exchange side by side so that the learners know what the dex logos mean. The learners can click on the text
hyperlinks and be directed straight to the dex app address to learn more and familiarise themselves without having to google for the dex
app web addresses.

For 3, we use div css box models to serve as the hyperlinks with each chartprovider website address as the box contents. Once the 
learners click on the hyperlinks they will be directed to the chartprovider websites directly to see how cryptocurrencies pairs
are display in charts for their price action.

For 4, we use bootstrap carousel to showcase the 3 top jewel resource links so that learners get to visit the resources when they click
on the carousel items. The 1st carousel item is the pinksale.finance website which learners get to see the initial coin offerings for 
a very popular ico website. The 2nd carousel item is the cryptobubble website which uses an interesting graphical way for showing which
are the more popular and volatile cryptocurrencies. The 3rd carousel itme is the webpage showcasing the most recent telegram popular clicker games.

For 5, we use https://www.apispreadsheets.com/ to create a working contact us form with a free api to save the data submitted on
the apispreadsheets.com. The data submitted can be access by signing into the apispreadsheet website or using the web address https://www.apispreadsheets.com/table/W063dsUu2px7KN61/ to see the data submiited by learners.

Other Future Features to implement:
Another important feature which we can share in the future is on the different crypto wallets which learners can use to
access the decentralized exchanges(DEX) as there are different popular crypto wallets for different blockchains use.
We can also share a quick historical timeline of how cryptocurrency and blockchain has come about.



[Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Used for using HTML code to design the webpages.
- CSS(with bootstrap and google fonts): Used for styling the webpages collectively.
- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/ Used for the framework it provides which provide a basic setup for the CSS. Bootstrap also provides
  certain code templates for the html elements in the webpages. We have used the carousel element code for CryptoJewels project.
- Google Font: https://fonts.google.com/ Used for selecting certain suitable fonts for the CSS styling for the webpages.
- W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/ Used for helping us code for the various elements in the webpages such as the inline span block,
  flex container and div class.
[In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.]

[JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:]

## Contact form:

Contact form:
The design of a contact us form using the api link and form design resources at https://www.apispreadsheets.com/ works fine with the learner submitting their name, email address and remarks. The data submitted can be obtained at the https://www.apispreadsheets.com website itself. However, if no information is keyed into the form and the submit button is pressed, there is no error code displayed
and the empty form fields are submitted as an entry on the data sheet.

[Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.]

I received inspiration for this project from the fact that i see many newcomers to cryptocurrencies do
not know where to start learning about cryptocurrency and blockchain so i wanted to design this
CryptoJewels website to share with them.
